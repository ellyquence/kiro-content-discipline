# Voice and Tone Guidelines

## Understanding Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** is your brand's personality—it stays consistent across all content. Think of it as WHO you are.

**Tone** adapts to the situation while maintaining voice. Think of it as HOW you express yourself given the context.

You have one voice but many tones. You speak differently when celebrating a win vs. addressing a problem—but you're still you.

## Voice Attributes

Define your brand voice using these four spectrums. Mark where your brand falls:

### 1. Formality Spectrum
```
Casual ←――――――――――――――――――→ Formal
  □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
```
- Casual: Contractions, conversational, first-person
- Formal: Complete sentences, third-person, professional

### 2. Enthusiasm Spectrum
```
Reserved ←――――――――――――――――――→ Enthusiastic
   □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
```
- Reserved: Measured, factual, understated
- Enthusiastic: Energetic, exclamation points, excitement

### 3. Humor Spectrum
```
Serious ←――――――――――――――――――→ Playful
  □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
```
- Serious: Straightforward, no jokes, professional
- Playful: Wit, wordplay, lighthearted

### 4. Authority Spectrum
```
Peer ←――――――――――――――――――→ Expert
□ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
```
- Peer: "We're figuring this out together"
- Expert: "Here's what you need to know"

## Tone Adaptation Matrix

Adjust tone based on content type and reader state:

| Situation | Reader State | Tone Adjustment |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Educational content | Curious, learning | Encouraging, patient |
| Error/problem content | Frustrated, confused | Calm, helpful, solution-focused |
| Success/celebration | Happy, accomplished | Celebratory, warm |
| Promotional content | Skeptical, evaluating | Confident, evidence-based |
| Sensitive topics | Concerned, vulnerable | Empathetic, careful |
| Technical content | Focused, analytical | Clear, precise, no fluff |

## Writing Style Rules

### DO:
- Use active voice (aim for 90%+ active sentences)
- Write in second person ("you") to speak directly to readers
- Use contractions naturally (don't, you're, it's)
- Keep sentences short (average 15-20 words)
- Break up long paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Use transition words to guide readers
- Explain jargon when you must use it

### DON'T:
- Use passive voice unless necessary
- Write in third person about your own brand
- Use buzzwords without substance ("synergy," "leverage," "paradigm")
- Hide behind corporate speak
- Use excessive exclamation points (max 1 per section)
- Start multiple sentences with "I" or "We"
- Use filler phrases ("In order to," "Due to the fact that")

## Word Choice Guidelines

### Prefer:
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Utilize | Use |
| Facilitate | Help, enable |
| Leverage | Use, build on |
| Synergy | Teamwork, collaboration |
| Paradigm | Model, approach |
| Bandwidth | Time, capacity |
| Circle back | Follow up |
| Deep dive | Explore, examine |
| Move the needle | Make progress, improve |
| Low-hanging fruit | Quick wins, easy opportunities |

### Power Words to Include:
**Trust**: Proven, guaranteed, backed, certified, authentic
**Urgency**: Now, today, limited, don't miss, deadline
**Value**: Free, bonus, exclusive, save, instant
**Emotion**: Discover, reveal, secret, surprising, transform

## Voice Consistency Checklist

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Tone matches reader's likely emotional state
- [ ] No jarring shifts in formality
- [ ] Jargon explained or avoided
- [ ] Active voice predominant
- [ ] Sentences varied in length
- [ ] Brand personality comes through
- [ ] Would sound natural if read aloud

## Examples: Same Message, Different Tones

**Message**: Our service is currently experiencing issues.

**Casual/Empathetic**:
"We hit a snag. Our team is on it, and we'll have things running smoothly soon. Thanks for your patience."

**Professional/Informative**:
"We're currently experiencing a service disruption. Our engineering team is actively working on a resolution. We'll update you within the hour."

**Formal/Corporate**:
"We are aware of the current service interruption and are working diligently to restore normal operations. We apologize for any inconvenience."

Choose the tone that matches YOUR brand voice.
