# Readability Standards

## Target Reading Level

**Standard**: All content must score **Grade 8 or below** on the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scale.

**Why Grade 8?**
- The average American adult reads at an 8th-grade level
- Higher readability = wider audience reach
- Simpler writing is faster to consume
- Mobile readers skim—clarity wins
- Non-native speakers can engage

**Note**: Writing simply doesn't mean dumbing down. It means communicating complex ideas clearly.

## Readability Metrics

### Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
- **Target**: ≤ 8.0
- **Formula**: Based on sentence length and syllables per word
- **Lower is more readable**

### Flesch Reading Ease
- **Target**: 60-70 (standard), 70-80 (preferred)
- **Scale**: 0-100 (higher = easier)
- **Benchmarks**:
  - 90-100: 5th grade (very easy)
  - 80-90: 6th grade (easy)
  - 70-80: 7th grade (fairly easy)
  - 60-70: 8th-9th grade (standard)
  - 50-60: 10th-12th grade (fairly difficult)
  - 30-50: College level (difficult)
  - 0-30: College graduate (very difficult)

## Sentence Guidelines

### Length
- **Target**: 15-20 words average
- **Maximum**: 25 words per sentence
- **Vary length**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer ones

### Structure
- Lead with the main point
- One idea per sentence
- Avoid nested clauses
- Break up run-on sentences

**Before** (32 words):
"In order to effectively optimize your content for search engines while also ensuring that it remains engaging and valuable for your readers, you need to balance multiple factors simultaneously."

**After** (18 words average):
"Great content balances SEO with reader value. Here's how to optimize for both without sacrificing either."

## Paragraph Guidelines

### Length
- **Target**: 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- **Maximum**: 5 sentences
- **Single-sentence paragraphs**: Use sparingly for emphasis

### Structure
- Topic sentence first
- Supporting details follow
- One main idea per paragraph
- White space between paragraphs

### Visual Rhythm
Vary paragraph lengths to create visual interest:
```
Medium paragraph with a few sentences explaining a concept clearly.

Short punch.

Another medium paragraph that develops the next idea with supporting details and examples.

Then maybe a longer paragraph when you need to explain something more complex, but even then keep it focused on a single idea and break it up if it starts to feel dense or overwhelming to read.

Short closer.
```

## Word Choice

### Prefer Simple Words

| Complex | Simple |
|---------|--------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Implement | Start, do |
| Approximately | About |
| Subsequently | Then, after |
| Commence | Start, begin |
| Terminate | End, stop |
| Endeavor | Try |
| Sufficient | Enough |
| Numerous | Many |
| Purchase | Buy |
| Inquire | Ask |
| Obtain | Get |
| Demonstrate | Show |
| Regarding | About |

### Avoid Jargon
If you must use technical terms:
1. Define on first use
2. Use plain language alternative when possible
3. Don't assume reader knowledge

**Before**: "Leverage synergies to optimize your KPIs."
**After**: "Use teamwork to improve your key metrics."

### Minimize Adverbs
- **Cut**: very, really, extremely, absolutely, definitely
- **Replace** weak verb + adverb with strong verb
  - "Ran quickly" → "Sprinted"
  - "Said loudly" → "Shouted"
  - "Walked slowly" → "Strolled"

---

## Active vs. Passive Voice

### Target: 90%+ Active Voice

**Active**: Subject performs the action
**Passive**: Subject receives the action

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| The report was written by Sarah | Sarah wrote the report |
| Mistakes were made | We made mistakes |
| The button should be clicked | Click the button |
| It is recommended that... | We recommend... |

### When Passive is Acceptable
- Unknown actor: "The building was constructed in 1920"
- Emphasizing result: "Three people were injured"
- Scientific convention: "The sample was heated to 100°C"
- Diplomatic softening: "Errors were found" (vs. "You made errors")

---

## Formatting for Scannability

### Use Headers Generously
- Break content every 300 words maximum
- Headers should be descriptive (not "Part 1")
- Readers scan headers to find what they need

### Bullet Points and Lists
Use lists when presenting:
- Multiple related items
- Steps in a process
- Features or benefits
- Comparisons

**List Guidelines**:
- 3-7 items ideal
- Parallel structure (all start same way)
- Short items (one line preferred)
- No periods for fragments, periods for full sentences

### Bold Key Points
- Bold important terms on first use
- Bold action items and key takeaways
- Don't over-bold (loses impact)

### Use White Space
- Space between sections
- Space around images
- Don't crowd the page
- Mobile readers need room
