# Content Creation Global Standards

## Core Philosophy

This project follows **quality-first content creation** with systematic quality gates. Every piece of content must pass through defined checkpoints before publication. The goal: create content that is genuinely helpful, demonstrates expertise, and builds trust with readers.

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Being understood beats being impressive
2. **Value over volume** - One excellent piece beats ten mediocre ones
3. **Reader-first** - Every decision serves the audience, not the algorithm
4. **Evidence-based** - Claims require sources, opinions require disclosure

## Content Types

| Type | Purpose | Typical Length | Primary Framework |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Blog Post | Inform/educate | 1,200-2,500 words | AIDA or PAS |
| How-To Guide | Teach skills | 2,000-4,000 words | Step-by-step |
| Listicle | Quick value | 1,000-2,000 words | Numbered sections |
| Opinion/Thought Leadership | Persuade/position | 800-1,500 words | PAS or Story Arc |
| Case Study | Prove results | 1,500-2,500 words | Problem-Solution-Results |
| Roundup/Compilation | Aggregate value | 2,000-3,500 words | Categorized sections |
